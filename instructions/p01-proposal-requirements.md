|Abstract | Our main question is  how do we take data from active listeners to give them a recommended playlist; For example, what BPM do they listen to, what is their favorite artist, do they like similar songs? To address this question we will research and look into how data sets are combined and suggested through the users choice of music. We plan to read about streaming services and learn how the spotify data sets work to organize the selection of suggested music.  |
|Keywords | Music, Spotify Streaming, Global |
|Introduction | Finding new music to listen to seems to be a constant struggle. Sure streaming platforms all have their own recommendation algorithms, but it feels like you've heard all these songs before. We wanted to reinvent the music recommendation process. Our project uses a data set that tracks popular songs from around the globe that were listened to on Spotify. We got our dataset from kaggle. It looks at variables such as: song name, country, date, artist, genre, streams, and a position it appears in a country’s chart . We want to develop a website that helps people find new artists and music to listen to based on songs, artists, and genres they like. You would answer a few questions to gauge your music taste, and in return the website provides personalized music recommendations. We could show different songs that are  trending around the globe. We have graphics that break down the stats of popular songs and artists in different countries. We want our website to be interactive and focus on a global perspective. Expanding your worldview and exposure to different cultures through music. |
|Problem Domain | In the past generation of music, becoming discovered as a new artist was a very hard feat to accomplish. However, over the past few years, streaming services have made this feat easier to accomplish by using data sets collected by users' interactions to recommend new artists and songs. “Yet, as algorithmic recommendations take center stage in the music discovery landscape, the professional community at large still perceives these recommender algorithms as black boxes.”(Jones, Morgan) Music professionals rely on recommender systems across platforms like Spotify and YouTube to increase the ad budgets, connect with new audiences, and all-around execute successful release campaigns. While often having no clear vision of how these systems operate and how to leverage them to amplify artist discovery. The topic of unveiling AI-driven recommender systems and providing music professionals with the resources and tools they need to understand and manage these algorithms will be a big focus for Music Tomorrow throughout 2022. Our focus for this project is to figure out how these recommendation playlists are created and how they affect the direct and indirect stakeholders. Possible harms to the stakeholders are the accessibility issues. No matter what your favorite genre is, chances are your information is accessed and most data falls through a crack in the process, music services are afflicted by a data gap. This impacts not only how music cultures evolve, but how artists who fit into an acceptable genre are compensated versus those who fall through the cracks. The main cause of this disconnect is the misanalysis of, or a failure to even see, various subgenres of music styles. That is one of the main harms in the creation of this algorithm. Benefits would fall upon popular artists and the direct stakeholders because they only see who they like and the popular artists can make more money. As you can see in the graphic above, the streaming sites take up a large majority of the music industry. As a result of this, this algorithm has the potential to make unpopular artists less popular and popular artists rise to the top, creating a big gap. However our main goal is to learn how we take data from active listeners to give them a recommended playlist; For example, what BPM do they listen to, what is their favorite artist, do they like similar songs. We will take on the challenge of understanding how the recommended playlist works so we can benefit the direct stakeholders and indirect stakeholders.
|Research Questions | Our main question is how do we take data from active listeners to give them a recommended playlist; For example, what BPM do they listen to, what is their favorite artist, do they like similar songs. The motivation behind this question is that this is what the bulk of our project is, figuring out how the specific data sets are paired and how new songs are suggested. We are concerned with finding popular songs across different countries because we want to know if music taste can span cultures and languages. To address this we can filter the data to find the most popular songs, genres, and artists by country. Another research question we want to explore is how to provide equal opportunities to every artist within the platform. The reason for this is that to cross cultures, we should not be restricted to a single genre such as pop or R&B. By creating a user-oriented algorithm, we can categorize the recommendation lists into various sections like "popular artists," "new artists," and thus users can explore different artist and genre based on their preferences. Another thing we will consider is the way we design the user interface. Motivation: Being the first thing user will see, it is important to make the website as straightforward and neat as possible. So base on top of that, we need to explore different ways to arrange buttons/sections and provide users with the most convenient way to explore music.|
|The Dataset | **(1)** The dataset contains variables that are related to the problem domain/research question, and this includes name, country, streams, and genre. Since our research question is about taking data from active listeners in order to give them a recommended playlist, we will take the variables and filter them to answer it. The most crucial variables will be the name of the song, and the amount of streams. Getting the data that represents the most streamed song in a certain year and demographic will allow for our project to generate a recommended playlist to listeners, based on a specific genre they like. To determine the type of genre/music a listener likes, a survey would be made.

|---|
 The main data set (Spotify tracks chart dataset (2014-2022) comes from Kaggle, and it was created by Julian Freyberg. The dataset was created in 2014, and it was last updated about 10 days ago by Freyberg. The purpose for collecting the data is to collect information from Spotify from many different countries. The information allows for the viewers to see which songs had the most streams. Freyberg most likely funded and benefited from the data, since he got credibility from it. Additionally, Spotify also benefits from the data, since the database revolves around it. People who have interest in listening to a song from the dataset, created more popularity for Spotify; thus, the data can be seen as a marketing tool. To add on, the data is collected weekly directly from Spotify, which indicates that it is validated and held secure. Freyberg collected data directly from https://kworb.net/spotify/. The data is also credible and trustworthy since the author has created datasets before. The place where the data comes from also causes it to be trustworthy since it was not altered. We obtained this data by searching through the data science tool, Kaggle. |

|Expected Implications | Technologists: In the future, technologists can utilize what we have to create unique, user-oriented projects across a wide range of fields. We envision our project to be applicable to a wide range of fields, including music, real estate, food delivery, the automobile market, and many others. A designer's main objective is to create unique visual representations that help customers understand their needs. Our website allows designers to better understand what their clients need by accessing it. Furthermore, designers are capable of developing efficient solutions that satisfy clients' requirements and, most importantly, create visuals that are unique and personal for clients. Policymakers can better understand people's needs by evaluating the data our program provides and, based on those needs, modify regulations to meet those needs. By using our project, policymakers can better understand people's needs and eventually develop a more equalized social environment.|
|Findings | We started out this project with one main goal, to figure out how spotify makes the recommended playlist for users. Collecting and analyzing the data was one of the easy parts, but collecting data from private users was something we were not able to do. However, we were able to use the data we found to determine how the popularity trends worked on a global scale. We found out when artists should release music because of the popular listening trends in different countries in addition to what genres have an easier chance to gain more streams per day.  Research showed that May and June are great months to release new music and also coincide with more touring and festival opportunities for the artists. Fall is a great time to release new music because people are back to work and back to school. January is a slow month for bigger artists releasing new projects but works well for emerging and independent artists. While these months are very popular to release music there are certain times of the year to avoid. Around the holidays, industry professionals are usually checked out and spending time with their families. December is not the best time to release new music because people’s attention spans are elsewhere. Another bad time to release new music is in the month of August, it is the end of summer and most of the industry and people are enjoying their last few weeks of sunshine and family until labor day. However once this month ends new music streaming skyrockets after labor day as the academic year starts. Going onto the second finding, we discovered that in the 20 highest populated countries that stream music, 64% of the streamers listen to Pop as their number 1 genre. The second most popular genre was Rock with a large 57% of streamers listening. And thirdly, we had EDM with a strong 32% of streamers across the countries. This was not surprising because the visualizations we produced proved these statistics to be true. The bar charts were created based on popularity in countries and off songs, having the highest values were pop songs. Also the pie chart that we created also showed that the most popular genre was Pop. We can see that the trends prove themselves in the popular streaming countries, we don’t know the reasoning behind it though; whether it be the high bpm or synths, it could be part of our next project. |
|Limitations |The importance of our project does not affect anything major on a global scale, but something smaller, the music industry. However, on the bonus we can focus on how our data set and visualizations can help artists in the industry and producers. We were able to determine the best parts of the year to release music for up and coming artists by looking at streams based listening throughout the year. One important thing to remember is that we only looked at the year 2022, but we peeked into certain time gaps in prior years and found the same popularity trends during the summer and fall months. We found that streaming data allows you to find songs of the same genre but less streamed than the popular ones. After further research on the web about streaming services, we found that most producers find undiscovered artists on streaming platforms like spotify and apple music. There are many artists on streaming platforms who might have thousands of listeners and might not have played a show, nor considered playing live at all.  This information can be used both by the booking agent, and an artist to book shows. What this provides to the smaller artists is the ability to become a top hit and make a lot of money and influence other artists. One thing that is important to remember about this is that the genre plays a big part in popularity within a community. As we said in the Findings section, Pop was the most popular genre with Rock and EDM following. These genres have more potential to have the artists earn a higher income than artists that operate in the genres of Opera or Blues. Looking at this information, a young person who wants to make music in the future might make his/her decision on how money is earned among the genre differences. We dove into some online searching to find some answers to this question. “As a musician, you express your art through a genre that you feel communicates the most to your listeners. Some artists play more than one genre, but others are more comfortable in playing just one.” an anonymous user stated. So it's not so much on how much money you want to make, it has to do with happiness and what you want to do with your talents. As we provided the data to support future artists with information on popularity trends, sometimes it is best to do what makes you happy whether that be a pop singer or an opera singer. |
|_Conclusion_ | Overall, top song rankings in many countries around the world can differ from one another. It was discovered that globally ranked songs in 2022 had a large amount of popularity in a few larger countries, rather than popularity in multiple countries. For example, Pepas received the most streams from Spain, France, and Amsterdam. This caused the song to be number one in the 2022 Spotify global charts. The song also had one of the highest number of streams daily. Also, the type of song, including the language, instruments, and style can cause it to have more popularity in some countries compared to others. Going back to the Pepas example, the song is a Spanish EDM song. Therefore, it would have more popularity in European countries. Especially since these types of countries have more Spanish speaking people, and are more popular for club music. Even though the top global songs are specifically popular in a few countries, the data can give Spotify users strong insight on songs that they may not know of. To expand on this, listening to new music from other parts of the world creates cultural awareness. Additionally, listening to these songs introduces the user to new genres, and singers, which can expand one’s music playlist. To add on, listening to new music allows for the listener to learn, especially since music is a form of education. With the charts that were created from the Spotify dataset, the user would be able to visually see the association between global songs, and streams. To specify, the bar chart represents the top 15 songs that were streamed daily, along with the amount of streams. Whereas, the map chart shows the top 5 songs with the amount of streams, specifically in each country. The line chart shows the relationship between the top 3 songs with the amount of streams at the end of September 2022. Each chart contains a pattern between top songs, along with the amount of streams, and this is crucial towards finding a connection between the two. Using Spotify as the main data is a strong start towards finding top songs around the globe, but it is not likely that every single country uses Spotify as their main source of listening to music. Therefore, to expand and have more accuracy, adding in additional data from YouTube, Apple Music, and more would be an extension. In other words, only using Spotify data was the main limitation. Nonetheless, with the data that was collected, people are able to explore songs from different areas and share with one another. |
