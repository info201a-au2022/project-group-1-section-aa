# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[app.R](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-1-section-aa/blob/main/source/app.R) | Where we store the UI and SERVER for our Shiny app
|[server.R](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-1-section-aa/blob/main/source/server.R) | Where we store all the function to get the Shiny app to run
|[UI.R](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-1-section-aa/blob/main/source/ui.R) | The codes of our User Interface
|[interactive_bar_chart.R](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-1-section-aa/blob/main/source/interactive_bar_chart.R) | Here is the interactive bar chart we used in the final project (1st visual)

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete this NOTE sections (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
